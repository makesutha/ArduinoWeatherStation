# MiniWeatherStation
### Mini Weather Station is an example of a Personal Weather System (PWS). A personal weather station (PWS) is a set of weather measuring instruments operated by a private individual, club, association, or business (where obtaining and distributing weather data is not a part of the entity's business operation). Personal weather stations have become more advanced and can include many different sensors to measure weather conditions.
This project is based on the Arduino Microcontroller for reading the sensors and ESP8266 Module for communications.
